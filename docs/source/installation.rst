Installation
------------

DC/OS E2E consists of a :doc:`library` and a :doc:`cli`.

The CLI works only with the :doc:`docker-backend`, while the library supports multiple :doc:`backends`.
The CLI can be installed with Homebrew on macOS, and the library and CLI can be installed together with ``pip`` on any Linux and macOS.

Windows is not currently supported, but we provide instructions on using DC/OS E2E on Windows with Vagrant on particular :doc:`backends`\ ' documentation.
